This repository is used to track my Code Wars solutions throughout 301 

Will include:

1. README.md file with the description of the problem domain from Code Wars, a link to the challenge on Code Wars, and an overview of your process for solving the challenge.

2. Picture of your pseudocode from the whiteboarding exercise 

3. JavaScript file of your solution after confirming that it passes on Code Wars. Your TAs will be confirming that your solution passes the tests, so make sure that it is complete before adding it to your repo.
